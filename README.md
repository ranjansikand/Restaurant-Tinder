# ECS 162 - Final Project - Restaurant Tinder

Created by Ranjan Sikand, Sayed Yoseph Sadat, and Muhammed Halbutogullari

## Issues

### There are some bugs:

- If no resturants are returned, the game never loads/works. This happens with obscure cuisine types.
  As a solution, we indicate to the players when the search returned no results so they can start over.

- The game occassionally messes up and declares the wrong restaurant as the winner.

- Ocassionally the CPU is overloaded and the app needs to be refreshed.

## Problems with Glitch

### Glitch being down

- We have had several problems with Glitch this week. Most of our problems were due to the extended amount of time glitch was down this week.
  Given that 2/3 of us are essential workers and were working, and the other is taking an extensive load of upper division CS classes, the time
  we have had to all collectively work on the project at the same time have been far and few in between. However, even when we wanted to set time
  to work or work together, Glitch was almost always down (especially toward the beginning of this week). This made it very hard to get into a good
  groove and make substantial progress until later on in the week.

### Glitch removing work

- On a few instances, Glitch has even deleted some progress on the work we've done or has not registered our saves. 
  We only discovered that we had the option to export to github recently, but not before we had a night's worth of work completely ereased. 
  This has set us back a few hours, and that time could've been put into adding new features that we wanted to implement but couldn't (like a review button).

- There were times where I would make additions to a file, refresh the page, and the additions have not been saved. At first, we did not know this
  and we would cotinue to work assuming everything was fine until running into a bug later that says we have undeclared variables which we did
  put, but was not saved.

## Final notes:

- Last weekend was the majority of our free time, right when glitch imploded on everyone. This was one of many setbacks we faced, on top of current social events.
- Unfortunately, as a result, the game logic is somewhat glitchy and does not work sometimes.
