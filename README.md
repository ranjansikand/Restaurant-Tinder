# ECS 162 - Final Project- Restaurant Tinder

### Some notes:
2/3 of us are employed and thus the last weekend made up the majority of our collective free time, right when glitch imploded on everyone. The game logic is somewhat glitchy and does not work sometimes as a result.


### There are some bugs:
If no resturants are returned, the game never loads/works. This happens with obscure cuisine types. As a solution, we indicate to the players when the search returned no results so they can start over.
